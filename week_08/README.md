# Required readings

For this week, we'll have a quick introduction to coding, so please read: 

* an old [piece](http://www.jstor.org/stable/420315) from [Jonathan Nagler](http://politics.as.nyu.edu/object/JonathanNagler) providing some very useful advice on coding as related to ETL and data analysis. Still incredibly good advice that I follow to this day. You can read a recent summary blog post [here](https://blog.oup.com/2015/02/jonathan-nagler-writing-good-code/) updating that piece.

* you may want to read [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/)'s [book chapter](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/r.html) on coding in R, from his [R Packages book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz). It's certainly more tailored towards coding to build R packages, but still very useful.

# Complementary readings

A few resources that may serve you in the future:

* [The Practice of Programming](http://www.informit.com/store/practice-of-programming-9780201615869), per Jonathan's recommendation read the Preface, Chapters 1, 3, 5, 6, and the Epilogue.
* [The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html) to better understand object-oriented languages.
* [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/020161622X/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=devtools-20) with general advice on how to be a good programmer/coder.
