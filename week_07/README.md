# Required readings

We'll maintain the same two readings for this week:

* a very illustrative [piece](http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/stable/23723482?pq-origsite=summon&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) by
  [Hal Varian](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/) providing a 
  re-look at ML techniques from the perspective of a 
  social scientists originally trained in econometrics.   

* a path-breaking [piece](http://www.jstor.org.ezproxy.cul.columbia.edu/stable/25791835?pq-origsite=summon&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) 
  by [Brambor](http://thomas.brambor.com/), [Clark](https://pols.tamu.edu/about-us/faculty-directory/william-r-clark-charles-puryear-professor-of-liberal-arts/) and [Golder](http://mattgolder.com/) on interactions. It's undoubtedly 
  one of the least understood tools in statistical analyses, 
  despite being the bread and butter to address the types of 
  questions that social scentists typically ask. 

# Complementary readings

I am assuming that you have your econometrics ready to deploy,
but a quick brush-up never hurt anyone.  

Please take some time to refresh your matrix algebra for 
this week. A favorite go to resource is Bill Greene's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Econometric-Analysis-7th-William-Greene/dp/0131395386), 
especially Appendices A and C. We will be working with matrices
when computing and graphing interactions, so you'll be much better
off having a quck brush up.

There is a number of texts that delve deep into interactions (including Greene's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Econometric-Analysis-7th-William-Greene/dp/0131395386)). But a favorite go to is a site 
that Matt Golder created: [Interactions](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/). 
All things interactions, an invaluable resource.

Also, you might want to go back to [ESL II](https://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) to get a quick refresher on random forests.
